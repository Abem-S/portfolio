# 😎 Abemelek Samson | Software Developer Portfolio

> “Crafting immersive web experiences with nothing but HTML & CSS — no scripts, just style.”

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a CSS-only experience that blends logic, emotion, and glowing interactivity. Built for a hackathon, this site showcases my journey as a self-taught developer through storytelling, animations, and responsive design.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This portfolio is more than a showcase — it’s a reflection of how I think, learn, and create. I wanted to build something expressive without relying on JavaScript, using only HTML and CSS to craft an experience that feels personal, interactive, and visually striking. The glowing effects, toggle paths, and animated transitions are all hand-coded to demonstrate how far CSS can be pushed creatively.
